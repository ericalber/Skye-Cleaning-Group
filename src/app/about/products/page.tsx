    title: 'A laboratory dedicated to finish-safe performance',
    paragraphs: [
      'Every concentrate that enters a Skye caddy is tested on replica marble, lacquer, hardwood, stainless steel, and couture textiles. We recreate real-world soiling with synthetic oils, mineral deposits, urban grime, and makeup pigments, then measure dwell time, pH, and residue. If a formula clouds, etches, or dulls the finish, it never graduates to the field. The goal is simple: deliver hospital-grade cleanliness without compromising the architecture or luxury materials that define your property.',
      'Our lab calibrates dilution systems for each product, labeling bottles with QR codes that crews scan before dosing. That ensures microfiber glide remains effortless, glass dries streak-free, and stone retains its original sheen. By the time a concentrate reaches your property, it has already survived dozens of torture tests designed by our chemists and hospitality advisors.',

    title: 'Chemistry with conscience and compliance baked in',
    paragraphs: [
      'Sustainability is non-negotiable for the estates, private offices, and boutique clinics we serve. We catalogue Green Seal, EPA Safer Choice, Woolsafe, and EU Ecolabel approvals, documenting batch numbers, lot tracking, and expiry dates for every chemical. When clients pursue LEED, WELL, or corporate ESG reporting, we export usage logs that show exactly which solutions were deployed in each zone. The paperwork that backs your cleaning story is ready before auditors even ask.',
      'Consumables are portioned to minimize waste, microfiber is laundered in closed-loop systems, and scent programs rely on hypoallergenic capsules designed to complement—never overpower—the environment. Our lab even tracks packaging recyclability so procurement teams can align maintenance with sustainability goals without introducing operational friction.',
    ],

  {
    title: 'Tailored kits for every environment under your umbrella',
    paragraphs: [
      'High-rise residences, venture boardrooms, boutique medical suites, and flagship retail each require distinct chemistry choreography. We assemble modular kits by zone: kitchen suites receive degreasers compatible with designer appliances, wellness areas rely on botanical disinfectants and UV validation tools, while executive offices pair low-scent anti-static sprays with scent capsules curated by our hospitality partners.',
      'Because each property blueprint lives in our command center, crews receive update prompts whenever the lab optimizes a formula or introduces a new supplier. The transition happens seamlessly—the next visit arrives with the updated product, QR codes already linked to your reporting dashboard, and instructions embedded in the team’s mobile checklist.',

  {
    title: 'Innovation you can feel and prove after every visit',
    paragraphs: [
      'Clients care about the results, not the ingredients list, so we demonstrate the difference through measurable metrics. Air-quality sensors capture particulate reductions after fogging high-touch zones. Textile longevity is charted in our dashboard so you see how encapsulation chemistry extends fiber life. Stone gloss meters provide before-and-after readings that designers can forward to owners. The data proves that the right chemistry protects investment and elevates the guest experience.',
      'When an incident occurs—spilled red wine on cashmere, makeup residue on lacquer, surgical adhesive on vinyl—we deploy the lab’s specialty stain command kit. Technicians receive step-by-step microguides that match solvent to substrate, supported by neutralizing agents that halt damage before it spreads. The incident report documents every step so stakeholders trust that recovery was handled professionally.',
