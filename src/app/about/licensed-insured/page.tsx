    paragraphs: [
      'Skye Cleaning Group operates under an active California janitorial contractor license with a clean record. Our compliance team audits the state portal weekly, tracks renewal timelines six months in advance, and maintains digital copies of every endorsement in the client portal. Liability coverage exceeds the thresholds demanded by luxury HOAs, private clubs, and corporate portfolios, while workers’ compensation policies scale with seasonal headcount so no visit falls outside insured limits.',
      'For properties that require additional surety bonds or building-specific riders, our broker executes amendments within forty-eight hours. Every document receives version control and sign-off, giving asset managers proof that the crew inside their property is qualified, insured, and monitored in real time.',

    title: 'Safety choreography designed for zero incidents',
    paragraphs: [
      'Every field leader completes OSHA 30, GBAC infectious-disease control, ladder safety, and annual refreshers on lockout/tagout and bloodborne pathogen protocols. Toolbox talks happen at the beginning of each shift and are logged in the portal with attendee signatures. High-access jobs leverage IRATA rope access or aerial-lift certifications; we stage rescue plans, wind monitoring, and communication protocols before wheels leave the ground.',
      'Inside the property, our crews run color-coded microfiber, chemistry dilution systems, and Sharps disposal when required. Incident response guides live in every mobile device. If something occurs, supervisors launch a digital report with photos, corrective actions, and timelines so stakeholders stay informed without phone tag.',

    title: 'Finish-safe chemistries aligned with ESG goals',
    paragraphs: [
      'Our in-house lab tests every concentrate on replica marble, lacquer, hardwood, and textiles before it enters a Skye kit. We catalog Green Seal, EPA Safer Choice, and Woolsafe approvals, tracking batch numbers and expiration dates. When clients pursue LEED, WELL, or corporate sustainability targets, we export chemical inventories with usage data so progress reports are built on evidence, not estimates.',
      'Consumables are portioned to minimize waste, microfiber is laundered with closed-loop systems, and scent programs rely on hypoallergenic capsules logged in the blueprint. Sustainability is not aspirational—it is coded into the way every visit is executed and documented.',
    ],

    title: 'Data transparency for legal, finance, and facilities',
    paragraphs: [
      'Legal teams appreciate that NDAs, photo restrictions, HIPAA acknowledgements, and vendor onboarding packets live alongside the cleaning reports. Finance receives insurance certificates, W-9s, and batch invoices organized by property. Facilities managers see air-quality readings, supply usage, and maintenance notes in the same dashboard they use to review service recaps.',
      'Because everything exists in one command center, approvals move fast. Boards sign service agreements knowing compliance is airtight, and building security trusts that credentials, background checks, and access logs are always current and auditable.',
