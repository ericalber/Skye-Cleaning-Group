      'Every Skye engagement starts with immersion. We tour your property, study the finishes that demand specialty choreography, and interview the stakeholders who rely on our reports. The result becomes your concierge blueprint: access instructions, elevator rhythms, scent preferences, hospitality etiquette, and escalation protocols. The document lives inside our command center and updates after every visit so choreography adapts to travel calendars, investor tours, or last-minute family gatherings without breaking stride.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Operations engineered for zero guesswork',
    body:
      'Once the blueprint is approved, a lead concierge handpicks a core crew trained to protect your environment like an internal team. They arrive with finish-safe chemistries, microfiber coded by zone, and a run sheet synchronized to minimize disruption. Terrace furniture realigns before sunrise, wellness suites reset between appointments, and executive boardrooms are camera ready before the first handshake. Supervisors log air-quality readings, linen longevity, and supply usage into your private dashboard so you can prove ROI with a single link.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Specialists ready when the script expands',
    body:
      'High-profile properties experience surprises: art installations arriving overnight, livestreams confirmed minutes before broadcast, consulate events extending past midnight. Because the blueprint lives centrally, we plug in strike teams for textiles, post-event resets, stone restoration, or scent design without repeating onboarding. Confidentiality covenants, NDAs, and access passes are already documented, letting us deploy help within hours while protecting continuity.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Sustainability and governance woven into each visit',
    body:
      'Concierge cleaning must reinforce ESG commitments and compliance obligations. Our chemistries include Green Seal and EPA Safer Choice formulations, waste streams are sorted with photographic proof, and linen rotations are logged to extend asset life. OSHA, HIPAA, and NDA acknowledgements sit in the same reporting portal as your visit recaps so legal teams and building security have assurance without chasing files or vendors.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Reports your stakeholders actually circulate',
    body:
      'Results matter when ownership, family offices, or compliance teams ask for evidence. After every visit you receive a photographic recap highlighting completed zones, proactive maintenance notes, and curated recommendations to keep the property in peak condition between concierge sessions. Share the recap with leadership decks, attach it to investor updates, or forward it to planners to prove the Skye standard is being upheld without handholding.',

  {
    title: 'A concierge desk that scales with you',
    body:
      'Scale your service like a luxury brand. Whether you add a second residence, expand floorplates, or host seasonal events, your concierge manager calibrates scheduling, chemistries, and staffing so every arrival feels rehearsed. Strike teams arrive with the same hospitality scripts, reporting cadence, and finish-safe methodology implemented at the flagship property. Consistency becomes your competitive edge, and Skye is the silent partner keeping it polished.',

Elevator keycards, valet protocols, art conservation preferences, even how you prefer audio zones to fade at night—everything enters the Skye blueprint. That document becomes the single source of truth for every visit, every swing shift, and every specialty crew you request later.',
      'During the session we calibrate scent programs, agree on photographic boundaries, and log sustainability requisites. The more nuance you share, the more precisely we protect your brand. Facilities leads love that they can pull up the blueprint before budget meetings and show how Skye handles compliance, ESG, and guest experience in one controlled workflow.',

Once onsite, the crew splits into micro-zones: textiles, stone, glass, wellness, outdoor. Each specialist carries a mobile checklist linked to your dashboard, uploading timestamps, air-quality readings, and amenity notes in real time.',
      'Before departure, the supervisor performs a reverse tour—lights dimmed to the scene you specified, fragrance diffusers set to the agreed intensity, smart-home panels wiped and reprogrammed.
